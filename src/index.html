            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Eid al-Fitr is the first of two Islamic holidays</strong> in the lunar year (the second being <a href="/?day=Adha">Eid al-Aḍḥā</a>). The day celebrates the end of fasting for the blessed month of Ramaḍān.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is hoped that through their worship in Ramaḍān that they will have been forgiven for their past bad deeds and will be closer to God for the year to come.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Day</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Muslims gather for a congregational ritual prayer and sermon</strong> in the morning, typically followed by meeting up with friends to celebrate the day through gift-giving and eating.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Backstory</h4>
            <p>
              The significance of Ramaḍān lies in the fact that <strong>it is the month in which the Qurān, Muslim’s religious text, was first revealed</strong>, making it the best time of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a month spent fasting, praying, giving charity, reciting Qurān and seeking forgiveness from God [Allāh] and from others that one may have wronged.
            </p>
            <p>
              During a fast, Muslims forsake the most basic human desires - food, drink and sexual relations - in order to elevate their internal state to one that is hyper aware of every action it’s performing.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Scripture</h4>
            <p>
              God says about fasting in the Qurān: 
              <br><br>
              “Fasting was mandated for you, as it was mandated on those before you, <strong>so that you might become God-conscious</strong>.” <a href="https://quran.com/2/183?translations=85">(link)</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Qurān teaches Muslims that fasting isn’t to lose weight or to suffer throughout the day. Rather, it’s a means of becoming more aware of God in our actions and for the blessings He has given us

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Eid al-Adha is the second of two Islamic holidays</strong> in the lunar year (the first being <a href="/?day=Fitr">Eid al-Fitr</a>). The day celebrates one’s obedience to God [Allāh in Arabic]. 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Day</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Muslims gather for a congregational ritual prayer and sermon</strong> in the morning, followed by a symbolic act of sacrificing a livestock animal. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After some of the meat is distributed amongst the needy, the rest of the day is typically enjoyed with friends and family. 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Backstory</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Prophet Abraham [Ibrāhīm] was instructed by God to sacrifice his only son at the time, Ishmael [Ismāʿīl].</strong> Both father and son obeyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the tough command, both father and son obeyed the will of God and prepared to fulfill the act. However, just before Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael, God replaced Ishmael with an animal that Abraham sacrificed instead.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Moral</h4>
            <p>
              Through the example of Abraham and Ishmael, <strong>Muslims are reminded that God alone is deserving of their obedience</strong> — prioritizing the pleasure of the Creator over that of our own desires and wants.
              <br><br>
              Sacrificing the animal is done so that a Muslim can sacrifice some of their material wealth and time in a demonstration of said obedience to God.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Scripture</h4>
            <p>
              Allah, Himself, clearly states in the Quran: 
              <br><br>
              “The meat and blood of the sacrificed livestock does not physically reach God; <strong>rather, it is your devotion to God that is manifested.</strong><br><br>
              This is how He has subjected [the livestock] for you so that you may proclaim the greatness of God for what He has guided you to. 
              <br><br>
              And give good news to those who do good!” <a href="https://quran.com/22/37?translations=20">(link)</a>

            <p class="faq-question">How many Eid's are there?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              <strong>Muslims have two Eid celebrations in the lunar year.</strong>
              <br><br>
              The first is celebrated after fasting the month of Ramadan, “Eid Al-Fitr (The Festival of Breaking the Fast). 
              <br><br>
              The second Eid is celebrated during the pilgrimage period. This Eid is called, “Eid Al-Adha (The Festival of Sacrifice).”

            <p class="faq-question">Who is Allāh?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              <strong>“Allāh” is simply the Arabic term for “The God” put together.</strong>
              <br><br>
              By this understanding, Allāh is calling Himself, “the one and only God,” but as a proper noun.
              <br><br>
              Additionally, this is how Allāh addresses Himself in the Qurʾān, so Muslims like to use the name God gave for Himself over other translations and names.</p>

            <p class="faq-question">Why are Muslims following Abraham?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Muslims look to Muhammad (may God bless and preserve his legacy) as their primary guide and teacher in this world.
              <br><br>
              <strong>However, the Islamic tradition recognizes several other prophets.</strong> The Qurʾān is filled with lessons from the lives of other prophets of God.
              <br><br>
              These include: Abraham, Noah, Jonas, Job, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus (May God preserve all their legacies). </p>
